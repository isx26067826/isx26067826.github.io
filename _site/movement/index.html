  <p>This movement defending <a href="https://www.nonhumanrights.org/">animals rights</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Animals eat without pleasure, cry without pain, grow without 
knowing it; they desire nothing, fear nothing, know nothing.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Nicolas Malebranche</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Animal rights is the idea in which some, or all, non-human animals are 
entitled to the possession of their own lives and that their most basic
 interests—such as the need to avoid suffering—should be afforded the 
same consideration as similar interests of human beings.</p>

<p>Advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental 
protections on the basis of species membership alone—an idea known since
 1970 as speciesism, when the term was coined by Richard 
 D. Ryder—arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other. 
 They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or 
 used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of
  burden. Multiple cultural traditions around the world—such as Animism,
   Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—also espouse some forms of 
   animal rights.</p>

<p>Critics of animal rights argue that animals are unable to enter into a 
social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed 
up by the philosopher Roger Scruton, who writes that only humans have 
duties, and therefore only humans have rights. A parallel argument,
 known as the utilitarian position, is that animals may be used as
  resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering; they may 
  have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human 
  beings, and insofar as they have interests, those interests may be 
  overridden, though what counts as necessary suffering or a legitimate
   sacrifice of interests varies considerably. Certain forms of animal 
   rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and animal 
   laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have also attracted 
   criticism, including from within the animal rights movement itself,
    as well as prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the 
    enactment of the “Animal Enterprise Protection Act” (amended in 
    2006 by the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act).</p>
